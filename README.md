### 👋 Hi, I'm Mitch.

**I build secure AI agents for environments where "public code" isn't an option.**

Due to the nature of my work (US Military NLP & Tier-1 Banking Security), 99% of my commits are behind corporate firewalls or in air-gapped environments. I specialize in **high-compliance architectures**, **Zero Trust supply chains**, and **Edge AI**.

#### 🔬 Current R&D: SquishLabs (Private Lab)
In my spare time, I run **SquishLabs**, focusing on **Agentic Process Automation** and **Edge AI**.

**Current Experiments:**
* **Edge Agents:** Running Quantized LLMs on NVIDIA Jetson hardware.
* **Memory Systems:** Experimenting with **LangGraph** for cyclic reasoning and **Zep** for long-term memory persistence.
* **Firmware Security:** Hardening embedded devices against physical access attacks.

#### 🛠️ My Stack
* **Languages:** Python, Rust, C++
* **AI/Data:** LangChain, LangGraph, Vector DBs (Chroma/Pinecone), PyTorch
* **Infra:** Kubernetes, Terraform, Vault, Docker
* **Security:** Snyk, SonarQube, OPA (Open Policy Agent)

*Ask me about my experience architecting "Zero Trust" pipelines for Wells Fargo or parsing unstructured data for the DoD.*
